# Geovariances Machine Learning Course

Welcome to the Geovariances Machine Learning Course! This is a comprehensive course that covers a range of topics in machine learning, including Python, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data transformations, and both supervised and unsupervised learning.

# Course Overview

In this course, you will learn how to develop and implement machine learning algorithms using Python. We will begin with a brief introduction to Python and its data science libraries, followed by an overview of the machine learning process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. We will then dive into specific machine learning topics, including:

- Data preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and one-hot encoding
- Exploratory data analysis using data visualization techniques
- Unsupervised learning methods such as clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Supervised learning methods such as regression and classification

# Data Set
The course includes a series of practical exercises that utilize a multivariate-scale drilling dataset with geochemical and geometallurgical variables. The dataset is provided by Geovariances and is used to demonstrate the application of machine learning concepts in real-world scenarios.

# Installation
To get started with the course exercises, you will need to install Python 3 and the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
These libraries can be installed using the pip package manager.
